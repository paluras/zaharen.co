          Catoptrophobia, or the fear of mirrors, is the core of this
          installation. Through this work, I aim to explore the concept of sound
          self-mirroring based on motion tracking, with the premise of gradually
          distorting one's perception of oneself and expressing it through sound
          alterations. This installation was commissioned by the Meridian
          International Festival 2024.

          The first iteration of Catoptro-tono. My project collaborator was
          Python engineer Teo Milea. We used Ableton in conjunction with a
          trained artificial intelligence system to produce sound motion
          tracking. This work was part of the arca.expo 1.3 exhibition.

        The art installation exhibited at the 2021 Diploma Festival. The
        installation consists of four tvs and two pairs of headphones. Each TV
        is modified to represent an analog oscilloscope, which is used to
        visualize sound, and reflects one of the musical instruments used in the
        works. Because cathode ray tube televisions are perceived as
        "primordial" technology by the youth today, the television has been
        chosen as the primary visual component.
